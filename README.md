# SolGPT

## Project Overview

**SolGPT** is a specialized GPT model designed to generate Solana smart contracts based on user prompts. Developed for the Web3 AI Hackathon at Encode Club, SolGPT creates precise and functional Solana smart contract code, making it a powerful tool for developers working with the Solana blockchain. Leveraging Solana‚Äôs technologies, including the Solana Program Library (SPL) and the Anchor framework, SolGPT ensures that generated contracts adhere to blockchain standards and are optimized for performance.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Generation:** Generate Solana smart contracts for various use cases, including token creation, NFT minting, staking mechanisms, and decentralized applications.
- **Optimized Code:** Produces code that adheres to Solana's best practices and standards.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Accepts specific prompts to generate tailored smart contract code for different requirements.

## WIP

- **Automated Testing:** Future plans include generating tests for smart contracts to ensure their integrity post-deployment.
